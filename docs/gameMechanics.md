# Game Mechanics

## Introduction

This section provides an overview of the game mechanics for R-Type.

## Gameplay

R-Type is a side-scrolling shooter game in which you pilot a spaceship to face waves of alien enemies. The main objective is to survive these attacks while progressing through the levels. The gameplay is characterized by spaceship movement, projectile shooting, and power-up enhancements.

## Controls

Controls in R-Type depend on the platform you are playing on, but here is a typical controller configuration:

- Ship Movement: Use directional arrows.
- Primary Fire: Press the fire button to launch projectiles against enemies.
- Power-ups: Some items or enemies drop power-ups. Collect them to upgrade your ship's abilities, such as more powerful shots or protective shields.
- Use of Power-ups: Some power-ups are activated automatically, while others may require a specific action, such as pressing a dedicated button.

## Scoring

The scoring system in R-Type is based on the number of enemies destroyed, bonuses collected, and the duration of survival. Each defeated enemy earns a certain number of points, and power-ups can also influence your score. Players often aim to achieve a high score to rank among the best.
